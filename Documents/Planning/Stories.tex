\section{Stories}
These stories fit the first part of the project
\begin{itemize}
	\item Admins can create quizzes via the website
	\item Quizzes contain a variety of questions
	\item Admins can login to the website and run a session with a quiz
	\item Multiple different sessions can be run simultaneously
	\item The Admin specifies which question is being run
	\item Sessions can be joined by users via the website
	\item Users answer the question being displayed by the quiz
	\item The Admin can see what percentage of users connected to the session have answered
	\item The Admin can show the results of the question in a sensible format e.g. graph
	\item Admin can then save results as CSV or XML
	\item The Admin can load from saved file to display again
\end{itemize}
These ones fit the second part, though there are some stories from the first part that are the same for this one
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Admin creates slides in slideshow editor (Most likely Microsoft Office Power Point)
	\item The Admin can stream these slides to a session
	\item Users can join the session and follow the slides as they are used	
	\item The Admin can place question slides within the slides during creation
	\item These slides will act as questions for the users connected to the session
	\item Results are handled in the same way as the first web only part
	\item The Admin can embed HTML content in quiz slides during creation
\end{itemize}
