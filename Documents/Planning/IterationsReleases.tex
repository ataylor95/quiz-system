\section{Iterations Plan}
General Information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 10 iterations beginning on Thursdays remaining from when this written (22/02/2017)
	\item Leave 2 iterations for Report Writing and emergency bug fixing at the end, from iterations beginning 20/04/2017
	\item 8 iterations between then and now, these to be devoted to majority of coding
	\item ~3 iterations before mid-project demonstration
\end{itemize}
It would be beneficial to try and get the majority of coding done within the 8 iterations specified, this would give the final two iterations breathing room to put together the final document more formally and give some bug fixing time and cleaning up time. The Outline Schedule and Releases Plan sections will specify more what work will be completed when.

\section{Releases Plan}
The two major parts of the project are the web only portion and the slides streaming version. These can be broken into several smaller releases however it would be nice to have the first part finished for the mid-project demo and the second done by the end of development.
