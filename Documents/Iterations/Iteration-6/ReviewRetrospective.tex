\section{Review}
\subsection{Completed Stories}
Three stories have been completed this week:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Admin can show the results of the question in a sensible format e.g. graph
	\item Users should not be able to submit their own answers by altering the HTML, as they did with Qwizom
	\item The Admin can see what percentage of users connected to the session have answered
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Incomplete Stories}
None incomplete

\section{Retrospective}
\subsection{What went well}
An XP approach really helped with the design stage of the results, as it changed a few times during this iteration. If this was being done in a more planned way, those changes might have been harder to implement.
\subsection{What went badly}
N/A
