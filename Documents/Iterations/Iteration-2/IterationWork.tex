\section{Story: They can create a new quiz in the backend}
\subsection{Analysis - Breakdown of Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Need quiz/new form to add name
	\item Add validation
	\item This then redirects to quiz.show for this new quiz
	\item This page needs a button that can add a question
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design}
The design is split into two parts, design for the quiz/new page and a design for the question/new page:
(insert images for these, maybe some form of activity diagram?)
\subsection{Implementation}
Added create page which has a form, added validation to it

Could do validation with javascript.
\subsection{Testing}
Dusk tests:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test to create a new quiz
	\item Test the HTML validation for creating a new quiz
	\item Test backend validation of quizzes
	\item Test a quiz contains questions that have all been added before hand
	\item Test to add a question to a quiz
	\item Test to make sure the question page contains the relevent information
\end{enumerate}

\section{Story: They can edit an existing quiz they own}
\subsection{Analysis - Breakdown of Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is an edit button on quizzes that links to quiz/edit
	\item You can edit the name of the quiz
	\item You can remove questions
	\item You can add questions
	\item You can edit the content of a question
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design}
There was not much design for this stage as it only really adds an edit page which should look the same as the pages in the above story
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsection{Testing}
Dusk Tests:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test the deletion of a quiz
	\item Test the deletion of a question on a quiz
	\item Test the edit page of a quiz
	\item Test the edit page of a question
\end{enumerate}

\section{Non-Story Work}
\subsection{Seeding}
Some more data needed to be seeded for this section of work, the question data. This involved creating some new Model Factories and using them in the seeders correctly. One issue was trying to create many questions for individual quizzes, but this was overcome using some very basic looping and calling the model factories in the right places.
\subsection{Quiz Description}
It was decided that quizzes should probably have descriptions attached to them, in case the lecturer needs reminding of what it is in 6 months time. This involved creating a new migration and simply adding a column to the table.
