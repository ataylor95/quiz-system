\subsection{Completed Stories}
None
\subsection{Incomplete Stories}
Once again this week no actual story has been completed. This is due to the size of the story and also that some stories are a struggle to work on individually. It seems that the current work covers about six stories rather than just one. Something to not then is that once this piece of work is complete, the velocity will shoot up.
\newpage

\section{Retrospective}
\subsection{What went well}
General amount of work feels good, even if project velocity is 0. But as mentioned this is due to many stroies being worked on simultaneously.
\subsection{What went badly}
Finishing stories and breaking them up into smaller bits of work that can be finished to give a velocity.
