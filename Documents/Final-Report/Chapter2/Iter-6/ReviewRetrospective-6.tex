\subsection{Review and restrospective}
\subsubsection{Review}
Three stories have been completed this week:
\begin{itemize}
	\item (4) The Admin can show the results of the question in a sensible format e.g. graph
	\item (4) Users should not be able to submit their own answers by altering the HTML, as they did with Qwizom
	\item (2) The Admin can see what percentage of users connected to the session have answered
\end{itemize}
These difficulty estimates for these stories were all too high. Using a third party library made it easy to create the graphs and thanks to the way the system had been previously implemented, users submitting their own answers was a few lines of code to implement. The last story was changes somewhat as described above, however adding a simple number of the number of submitters was simple.

\subsubsection{Retrospective}
An XP approach really helped with the design stage of the results, as it changed a few times during this iteration. If this was being done in a more planned way, those changes might have been harder to implement.
