\subsection{Report writing}
The majority of this iteration was devoted to report writing. Whilst there is still some development to do, the report accounts for 30\% of the final grade and needed to be worked on. There were some small changes to phpdoc and comments added to the code, but no actual functionality was changed. In terms of the report, the first chapter concerning the background had been added. All the iterations documents were also added into the final report. There are a lot of TODOs scattered throughout, mostly for citations but also some to check with the project supervisor about certain details. Finally, some content was fleshed out for the testing chapter, giving an overview and descriptions of the technologies.
