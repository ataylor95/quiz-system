\subsection{Review and retrospective}
\subsubsection{Review}
Once again this week no actual story has been completed. This is due to the size of the story and also that some stories are a struggle to work on individually. It seems that the current work covers about six stories rather than just one. Something to not then is that once this piece of work is complete, the velocity will shoot up.

\subsubsection{Retrospective}
The amount of work completed was significant, even if project velocity is 0. But as mentioned this is due to many stories being worked on simultaneously.

However, finishing stories and breaking them up into smaller bits of work that can be finished to give a velocity.
