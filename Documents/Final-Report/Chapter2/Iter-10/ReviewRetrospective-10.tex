\subsection{Review and retrospective}
\subsubsection{Review}
Just the one story concerning the downloading of slides done this week. The story was given a difficulty of two, which is fairly accurate, even at the end of development. The use of a library made it easier, but there were still some minor issues as described above. The rest of the work this iteration also went well, as it was the last iteration and had little more than small bug fixes or corrections and report writing.
\subsubsection{Retrospective}
Everything seemed to go well, especially user testing which was a concern.
