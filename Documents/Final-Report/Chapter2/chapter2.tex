\chapter{Iterations}
Iterations were used during the development of this project, each iteration typically consisted of at least one story and often included non story based work. However, due to the iteration process, each story consisted of analysis, design, implementation and testing. Therefore, each of these bits of work are given within the iteration they were completed in, negating the need for an initial design section. This chapter also acts more like a diary as it documents what happened in each iteration.

\section{Outline}
TODO: could this be past tense instead?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Iteration 0 mostly involves the setting up of the tools to be used in the project, some research and the creation of an initial database design.
	\item Iteration 1 is concerned with the implementation of the database design and setting up the initial admin area with a list of quizzes owned by the admin who logged in.
	\item Iterations 2 focusses on the creation of quizzes by admin users.
	\item Iterations 3, 4 and 5 involves the implementation of running sessions.
	\item Iteration 6 focusses on the submission of answers and displaying results. It also deals with the security issue from Qwizdom.
	\item Iteration 7 involves making the application mobile responsive, the part two redesign which led to implementation of the the way slideshows could be run on the application.
	\item Iteration 8 is only concerned with report writing.
	\item Iteration 9 contains security testing, more report work, the server setup , and bug fixing.
	\item Iteration 10 is the last iteration and followed the final bits of report writing, the user testing, and the implementation of downloading results and various bug fixes.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tools used}
There were a number of tools used throughout development that do not fit under a single iteration. The main three were a Wordpress diary, a Trello board and Git. 

The diary was used to keep track of the major pieces of development done each week and any questions/ issues that needed to be raised during supervisor meetings. This was a simple Wordpress site that was set up several years ago and repurposed for the use in this project.

Trello is a project management tool that allows users to create a "board" for a project that then allows the creation of cards that tasks can be added to\cite{trello}. Feature tracking is a key part of the system as tasks and cards can be marked as complete, Trello suits XP based approaches as cards can be created and edited on the fly for each iteration. For this project, a card was created for each iteration, with a list of stories and tasks to be completed within that iteration. Once a task was completed, it was checked as such giving an easy to read percentage completion for the story. See \ref{fig:trello-board} below for an example of the board used in this project.

Git was used extensively during development, primarily for version control but also a form of backup and as an easy way to deploy the system. Version control is very important as it allows tracking changes to the project and if a mistake it made, can be used to undo these mistakes. It also allows branching out bits of functionality, so developing features can be done separate from the rest of the project and once working, merged back in. Github was used as the repository service due to it being free and easy to use\cite{github}.
