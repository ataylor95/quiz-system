This project converns creating an application that can be used within lectures by lecturers to allow students to answer questions and for the lecturer to display live results of these questions. This project is based on a preexisting application, called Qwizdom (TODO: cite) but this project aims to improve upon Qwizdom in several ways.

The system is a web based application built in Laravel, a PHP based framework. The system provides two main functions, firstly the running of questions on their own, and the second is to stream lecture slides with questions embedded within the slides to students. This system improves upon Qwizdom in several ways, it runs via a website rather than via a PowerPoint extension, meaning more lecturers can use it, and it provides more functionality such as more possible answers and students cannot submit their own answers as they can with Qwizdom.

Development followed an Extreme Programming approach, utilising a number of practices to help development.
