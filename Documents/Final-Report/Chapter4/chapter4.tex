\chapter{Testing}

\section{Overview}
At the start of the project, testing was to use two practices from Agile. These were Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. Whilst these two practices both failed due to a mixture of reasons as described in the Iterations chapter, testing was still performed within each iteration. Rather than go over the tests made each week within the previous chapter, this section will summarise the tests.
