\chapter{Testing}

\section{Overview}
At the start of the project, testing was to use two practices from Agile. These were Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. Whilst these two practices both failed due to a mixture of reasons as described in the Iterations chapter, testing was still performed within each iteration. Rather than go over the tests made each week within the previous chapter, this section will summarise the tests. Overall there were x tests (TODO: fill in) that test the overall functionality of the system. Unit tests were dropped for a number of reasons in favour of application tests (TODO: why? take from iter docs).

\section{Application Testing}
TODO: screenshot final output of tests, possible one running for appendices. Also could list all tests somewhere.

\section{Stress Testing}


\section{Security Testing}


\section{User Testing}

\section{Automated Testing}
TODO: remove this section?
Whilst CI was abandoned early on into the development of the application, the Dusk tests are easy to run and automatically execute within a browser if the appropriate browser drivers are available. This means that it should not be too hard to integrate these tests into a CI tool if required in any future development.
