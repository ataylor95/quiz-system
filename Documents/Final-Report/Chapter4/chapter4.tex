\chapter{Testing}

\section{Overview}
At the start of the project, testing was to use two practices from Agile. These were Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. Whilst these two practices both failed due to a mixture of reasons as described in the Iterations chapter, testing was still performed within each iteration. Rather than go over the tests made each week within the previous chapter, this section will summarise the tests. Overall there were x tests (TODO: fill in) that test the overall functionality of the system. Unit tests were dropped for a number of reasons in favour of application tests (TODO: why? take from iter docs).

\section{Application Testing}
TODO: screenshot final output of tests, possible one running for appendices. Also could list all tests somewhere.
To do application tests, a testing framework called Laravel Dusk (TODO cite https://mattstauffer.co/blog/introducing-laravel-dusk-new-in-laravel-5-4) was used, which is the default testing framework provided with Laravel 5.4. It runs the tests within a Chrome instance by running a standalone server which then calls the Chrome application installed on the machine that the tests are being run on. The advantages of running tests like this rather than say executing PHP ont he server and reading a virtual DOM is that this allows JavaScript on the page to be evaluated and executed. JavaScript is vital to many of the components of the application so if it was not usable within tests, many parts of the system would have to be ignored within the tests.

These tests test the application as whole, rather than individual bits of code. This allows the tests to be written with the original requirements, the stories, in mind and so makes these tests a good way to evaluate the application at the end of its development. Tests were organised by story, as these provided an area of the application that needed to be checked, which makes them more human readable for any future development.

\section{Automated Testing}
TODO: remove this section?
Whilst CI was abandoned early on into the development of the application, the Dusk tests are easy to run and automatically execute within a browser if the appropriate browser drivers are available. This means that it should not be too hard to integrate these tests into a CI tool if required in any future development.


Stuff to talk about:
comprehensiveness of testing incl bdd and cucumber etc
db stuff, like transcations and migrations
