I'd like to thank my supervisor Chris Loftus for his continues support and advice throughout the project, and my second marker Laurence Tyler for his feedback from the mid project demonstration. In addition, I would like to thank Alun Jones, Stephen James and Max Atkins for helping set me up a server to use for hosting the project.

I am also grateful to Carly Jackson and Kerey Taylor for taking time out to proof read my dissertation.
